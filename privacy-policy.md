# Privacy Policy for DayKap AI

_Last updated: November 2025_

DayKap AI is developed by Mohit S.  
This privacy policy explains how the app handles user data and privacy.

---

## 1. Overview

DayKap AI is a daily logging and AI-assisted reflection app that helps users summarize their day.  
The app operates **offline** and stores all user-generated data locally on the device.  
No personal information is collected, shared, or transmitted to external servers.

---

## 2. Data Collection

- **Personal Information:**  
  The app does **not** collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII), such as name, email, phone number, or location.

- **User Logs:**  
  All daily logs, reflections, or notes entered by the user are stored **locally** on the user’s device.  
  These entries never leave the device unless the user manually exports or shares them.

---

## 3. AI Model Usage

DayKap AI downloads an AI model (Gemma) once during the first launch.  
This model enables **offline AI summarization and insights**.  
No user data is sent online for AI processing — everything happens locally on the device.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

This app does **not** use any third-party analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting services.  
No data is shared with external providers.

---

## 5. Security

Since all user data remains on the user’s device, data privacy and security are inherently maintained.  
However, users are responsible for keeping their devices secure (e.g., using screen locks or backups).

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
